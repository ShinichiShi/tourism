            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Minoan Civilization (3000-1100 BCE)</h4>
                <p>The first advanced civilization in Europe flourished on Crete. The Minoans were known for their magnificent palaces, especially the Palace of Knossos, advanced art, and sophisticated culture. They were expert sailors and traders who dominated the Mediterranean trade routes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Mycenaean Period (1450-1100 BCE)</h4>
                <p>Following a decline in Minoan civilization, possibly due to natural disasters, Mycenaean Greeks from mainland Greece became dominant on Crete. This period is reflected in Greek mythology, including the famous legends of King Minos and the Minotaur.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Roman Period (69 BCE-330 CE)</h4>
                <p>Crete became part of the Roman Empire, serving as a key Mediterranean province. The Romans developed the island's infrastructure, building roads, aqueducts, and new cities.</p>

                <h4>Byzantine Period (330-1204 CE)</h4>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Modern Era (1898-Present)</h4>
                <p>After gaining autonomy from the Ottoman Empire, Crete officially became part of Greece in 1913. During World War II, the island was the scene of the Battle of Crete (1941).
